 Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
 ------------------------------------------------
Security information and event management, or SIEM, is a security solution that helps organizations recognize and address potential security threats and vulnerabilities before they have a chance to disrupt business operations. SIEM systems help enterprise security teams detect user behavior anomalies and use artificial intelligence (AI) to automate many of the manual processes associated with threat detection and incident response.

The original SIEM platforms were log management tools, combining security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) to enable real-time monitoring and analysis of security-related events, as well as tracking and logging of security data for compliance or auditing purposes. (Gartner coined the term SIEM for the combination of SIM and SEM technologies in 2005.)

Over the years, SIEM software has evolved to incorporate user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA), as well as other advanced security analytics, AI and machine learning capabilities for identifying anomalous behaviors and indicators of advanced threats. Today SIEM has become a staple in modern-day security operation centers (SOCs) for security monitoring and compliance management use cases.

Log Aggregation
---------------
Log aggregation is a crucial process involving the collection and standardization of log events from diverse sources within an IT infrastructure. This facilitates efficient log analysis, achieved through the following key steps:

1. **Installation of Agents:**
   - Initiate log collection by installing agents on endpoints.
2. **Parsing:**
   - Extract relevant information from log data and format it for analysis.
3. **Normalization:**
   - Standardize log formats to ensure uniformity and ease of interpretation.
4. **Filtration:**
   - Eliminate unnecessary or redundant logs to reduce noise and focus on critical data.
5. **Categorization:**
   - Classify logs based on their source, simplifying issue identification.
6. **Data Enrichment:**
   - Enhance logs with additional context, such as geolocation data and system details.
7. **Indexing:**
   - Efficient indexing enables rapid and precise log retrieval during analysis.
8. **Storage:**
   - Securely store aggregated logs for historical reference and compliance requirements.
9. **Writing Rules:**
   - Establish rules for log handling, routing, and alerting based on specific criteria or events.

## Types of Logs to Aggregate:
Effective log aggregation should encompass various log sources, including:
- System logs
- Web server logs
- Middleware logs
- Application logs
- Network flow logs
- Security system logs
- Database logs
- API Gateway logs
- Load balancer logs
- DNS logs
- Authentication service logs
- Proxy server logs
- Configuration changelogs
- Backup and recovery logs

Efficient log aggregation empowers organizations to proactively manage IT environments, detect anomalies, troubleshoot issues, and maintain a robust security posture.
