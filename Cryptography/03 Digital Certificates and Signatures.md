### What is a Digital Certificate?
A **digital certificate**, also known as a **public key certificate**, is a cryptographic tool that links the ownership of a **public key** to the entity that owns it. It is primarily used to authenticate and encrypt communications, ensuring the identity and security of the communicating parties.
### Key Elements of a Digital Certificate
- **Public Key**: The key that is being certified, enabling secure encryption.
- **Identifying Information**: Information about the entity that owns the public key (e.g., name, organization, domain).
- **Metadata**: Additional details about the certificate, including its validity period, issuer, etc.
- **Digital Signature**: The signature of the certificate issuer, confirming the authenticity of the public key.
### Role in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
The **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** manages the distribution and revocation of digital certificates. It helps authenticate and securely share public keys. PKI allows for public key encryption and digital signatures, ensuring secure communication over the internet.
### How Public Key Cryptography Works
Public key cryptography operates using **key pairs**:
- **Private Key**: Only the owner holds this key, used for signing and decrypting data.
- **Public Key**: Shared with others for encrypting data or verifying digital signatures.

A digital certificate enables an entity to share its public key securely with others for encryption or authentication purposes.

### Common Uses of Digital Certificates
1. **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Digital certificates secure connections between web browsers and servers (e.g., HTTPS websites).
2. **Email Security**: For signing and encrypting emails, ensuring the sender's identity and message confidentiality.
3. **Code Signing**: Developers sign software to prove the authenticity of the code and protect it from tampering.
4. **Device Authentication**: Devices like routers and modems use certificates to authenticate themselves, ensuring the authenticity of their communication.
### Types of Digital Certificates
Digital certificates are most commonly used in web-based security. The three main types of **SSL certificates** (which are now part of **TLS** protocols) used for web server authentication are:
1. **Domain-Validated (DV) SSL Certificates**:
    - Minimal verification.
    - Only requires proof of domain ownership.
    - Ensures encryption but provides no information about the entity behind the certificate.
2. **Organization-Validated (OV) SSL Certificates**:
    - Provides more validation than DV certificates.
    - Verifies domain ownership and the identity of the organization applying for the certificate.
3. **Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificates**:
    - Highest level of validation.
    - Involves a thorough vetting process to ensure the legitimacy of the organization and its domain ownership.
    - EV certificates often trigger the "green bar" in browsers, indicating a highly secure site.
Other types of certificates include:
- **Code Signing Certificates**: Used by software developers to sign applications and updates, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the code.
- **Client Certificates (Digital ID)**: Used to bind a user’s identity to a public key for digital signatures or encrypted communication.
### Benefits of Digital Certificates
- **Privacy**: By encrypting communications, digital certificates ensure that sensitive data cannot be intercepted by unauthorized individuals.
- **Ease of Use**: The digital certificate process is typically automated, making it easier to implement and use.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Digital certificates are relatively inexpensive, with many certificates available for under $100 per year.
- **Flexibility**: Organizations can set up their own **PKI** and issue internal certificates without relying on external certificate authorities (CAs), if desired.
### Digital Certificates vs. Digital Signatures
While both **digital certificates** and **digital signatures** involve public key cryptography, they serve different purposes:
- A **digital certificate** is used to verify and authenticate the identity of the certificate holder, ensuring that the public key belongs to the correct entity.
- A **digital signature** is used to verify the integrity of a message or document and authenticate the identity of the signer. It is generated by hashing the data and encrypting it with the sender’s private key.

In practice, a digital certificate is often used to verify the authenticity of a **digital signature**.
## Digital certificate limitations
- **Security.** Like any other security deterrent, digital certificates can be hacked. The most logical way for a mass hack to occur is if the issuing digital CA is hacked. This gives bad actors an on-ramp into penetrating the repository of digital certificates the authority hosts.
- **Slow performance.** It takes time to authenticate digital certificates and to encrypt and decrypt. The wait time can be frustrating.
- **Integration.** Digital certificates are not standalone technology. To be effective, they must be properly integrated with systems, data, applications, networks and hardware. This is no small task.
- **Management.** The more digital certificates a company uses, the greater the need to manage them and to track which ones are expiring and need to be renewed. Third parties can provide these services, or companies can opt to do the job themselves. But it can be expensive.
## TLS Best Practices
- [ ] Only enable TLS 1.2 & 1.3,  and disable older version like TLS 1.0/1.1 SSL 3.0.
- [ ] Disable weak ciphers like  NULL, RC4, DES, MD5-based suites.
- [ ] Use strong ciphers suites  like AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305.
- [ ] Automate certificate renewal via tools like Certbot & Let's Encrypt.
- [ ] Use ECDHE key exchange for forward secrecy, and avoid RSA, DH, ECDH.
- [ ] Obtain certificates from trusted CAs and use CAA records to restrict CAs.
- [ ] Use Certificates with minimum 2048-bit RSA or ECDSA (p-256+) keys.
- [ ] Implement certificate pinning for critical services to avoid MITM.
- [ ] Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS.
- [ ] Use encrypted session tickets or session IDs to speed up repeat sessions.
- [ ] Don't mix TLS & non-TLS content to prevent MITM and content injection.
- [ ] Use tools like Qualys SSL labs or testssl.sh to test your TLS configurations.
