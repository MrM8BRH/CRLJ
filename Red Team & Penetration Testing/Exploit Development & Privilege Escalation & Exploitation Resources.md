Exploit Development
-------------------
An exploit can be a program or piece of code, designed to take advantage of vulnerabilities in applications, and this is usually done by cybercriminals with the goal of ultimately installing malware, such as ransomware, launching DDoS attacks or other exploits. For blockchain projects, which are high-value targets for hackers, exploitations have serious implications as these blockchains store and process crypto assets and other valuable information.

And this is what makes exploit development so critical to the safety of digital assets and sensitive information housed on computer systems. Exploit development is essentially the act of finding vulnerabilities in software and applications and establishing how they can be used to overtake a targeted system. This is done by developing an exploit that can take advantage of vulnerabilities such as application security, and the idea is to gain information about potential exploits and address them before cybercriminals can use them against you.

Privilege Escalation
--------------------
Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, a design flaw, or a configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user.
