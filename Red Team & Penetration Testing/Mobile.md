Mobile Security
---------------
Mobile security, or mobile device security, is the protection of smartphones, tablets, and laptops from threats associated with wireless computing. It has become increasingly important in mobile computing. The security of personal and business information now stored on smartphones is of particular concern. Increasingly, users and businesses use smartphones not only to communicate, but also to plan and organize their work and private life. Within companies, these technologies are causing profound changes in the organization of information systems and have therefore become the source of new risks. Indeed, smartphones collect and compile an increasing amount of sensitive information to which access must be controlled to protect the privacy of the user and the intellectual property of the company. The majority of attacks are aimed at smartphones.

Mobile Application Penetration Testing
--------------------------------------
Mobile Application Penetration Testing, also referred to as “mobile app pen testing” or “mobile app security testing,” is an exhaustive assessment process that entails actively probing and evaluating a mobile application for weaknesses and vulnerabilities. This assessment is carried out by ethical hackers, also known as penetration testers, who simulate real-world attacks to identify security flaws. This process is crucial because it helps developers to pinpoint potential problems before malicious hackers can exploit them. Mobile Application Penetration Testing is a proactive approach to enhancing the security of mobile applications by identifying and addressing potential security threats.
