At first I want to make an important point, this speech is not propaganda or advertising for the Islamic religion, it is directed to everyone who is interested in knowing more about the Islamic religion and how it facilitates people's lives in all spheres of life.

**Thank God for the blessing of Islam**

Islam, a monotheistic belief system, encompasses an extensive set of values and ethical guidelines that direct the daily conduct of its adherents. At the core of Islamic teachings lie principles of compassion, justice, and peace. Muslims are urged to manifest these values in their interactions with others, giving prominence to traits such as kindness, empathy, and fairness. The integral concept of "Salam," denoting peace, is deeply ingrained in Islamic tradition, advocating for harmony and tranquility within oneself and the broader community. Furthermore, the pursuit of justice stands as a cornerstone of Islamic ethics, compelling individuals to uphold principles of fairness, equality, and integrity across all facets of life. Patience, honesty, compassion, and various other virtues are integral components of this ethical framework.

Avoid ridiculing individuals, whether they display weaknesses due to moral or other reasons. Instead, aim to support and guide them, steering them towards the right path and motivating them to achieve success.

Not listening to the inhibitors and moving away from the negative feeling and most importantly, trusting God in all things of life because he is the undying neighborhood and the creator of everything.

**Addressing Challenges Faced by Arab Professionals in the Field of Cybersecurity in Western Countries**

The issue of racism and persecution has been observed in various Western countries, including Europe and America, particularly concerning Arab professionals in the cybersecurity sector. It is crucial to acknowledge that these challenges are not universal and do not apply to all companies or countries. However, a significant number of Arab professionals have reported encountering difficulties in their workplace due to prevailing prejudices.

Within Islamic principles, there is an emphasis on the absence of racism, persecution, contempt, or marginalization. However, the experiences shared by many Arab professionals in Western countries paint a different picture. It is disheartening to note that certain factors, such as one's identity as a Palestinian or support for Palestine, can lead to expulsion or substantial marginalization within a company.

Several manifestations of these challenges include, but are not limited to:

- Do not allow the employee to take a break to pray and may only 5 minutes.
- Lack of understanding and respect for Muslim practices during the month of Ramadan, resulting in difficulties for Muslim employees.
- Delay in permanent job placement, with a tendency to offer temporary contracts.
- Insufficient investment in professional development.
- Assignment of undesirable or challenging tasks that other employees avoid.
- Imposition of undertakings with punitive fines.
- Limited privileges for certain employees.
- Constraints on freedom of expression.
- Limited opportunities to apply for jobs, often accompanied by inquiries about one's origin.
- Lack of confidence in Arab professionals.
- Functional marginalization, where employees are relegated to backend tasks and kept away from customer-facing roles.

It is important to note that these challenges are not reflective of all workplaces or individuals in Western countries. However, they underscore the need for increased awareness, education, and advocacy to foster a more inclusive and respectful work environment for professionals of diverse backgrounds. Organizations should strive to create policies that promote equality, diversity, and inclusion to ensure a fair and supportive workplace for all employees.
