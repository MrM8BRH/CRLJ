At first I want to make an important point, this speech is not propaganda or advertising for the Islamic religion, it is directed to everyone who is interested in knowing more about the Islamic religion and how it facilitates people's lives in all spheres of life.

**Thank God for the blessing of Islam**

Islam, a monotheistic belief system, encompasses an extensive set of values and ethical guidelines that direct the daily conduct of its adherents. At the core of Islamic teachings lie principles of compassion, justice, and peace. Muslims are urged to manifest these values in their interactions with others, giving prominence to traits such as kindness, empathy, and fairness. The integral concept of "Salam," denoting peace, is deeply ingrained in Islamic tradition, advocating for harmony and tranquility within oneself and the broader community. Furthermore, the pursuit of justice stands as a cornerstone of Islamic ethics, compelling individuals to uphold principles of fairness, equality, and integrity across all facets of life. Patience, honesty, compassion, and various other virtues are integral components of this ethical framework.

Avoid ridiculing individuals, whether they display weaknesses due to moral or other reasons. Instead, aim to support and guide them, steering them towards the right path and motivating them to achieve success.

Not listening to the inhibitors and moving away from the negative feeling and most importantly, trusting God in all things of life because he is the undying neighborhood and the creator of everything.

**Addressing Challenges Faced by Arab Professionals in the Field of Cybersecurity in Western Countries**

The issue of racism and persecution has been observed in various Western countries, including Europe and America, particularly concerning Arab professionals in the cybersecurity sector. It is crucial to acknowledge that these challenges are not universal and do not apply to all companies or countries. However, a significant number of Arab professionals have reported encountering difficulties in their workplace due to prevailing prejudices.

Within Islamic principles, there is an emphasis on the absence of racism, persecution, contempt, or marginalization. However, the experiences shared by many Arab professionals in Western countries paint a different picture. It is disheartening to note that certain factors, such as one's identity as a Palestinian or support for Palestine, can lead to expulsion or substantial marginalization within a company.

Several manifestations of these challenges include, but are not limited to:

- Do not allow the employee to take a break to pray and may only 5 minutes.
- Lack of understanding and respect for Muslim practices during the month of Ramadan, resulting in difficulties for Muslim employees.
- Delay in permanent job placement, with a tendency to offer temporary contracts.
- Insufficient investment in professional development.
- Assignment of undesirable or challenging tasks that other employees avoid.
- Imposition of undertakings with punitive fines.
- Limited privileges for certain employees.
- Constraints on freedom of expression.
- Limited opportunities to apply for jobs, often accompanied by inquiries about one's origin.
- Lack of confidence in Arab professionals.
- Functional marginalization, where employees are relegated to backend tasks and kept away from customer-facing roles.

It is important to note that these challenges are not reflective of all workplaces or individuals in Western countries. However, they underscore the need for increased awareness, education, and advocacy to foster a more inclusive and respectful work environment for professionals of diverse backgrounds. Organizations should strive to create policies that promote equality, diversity, and inclusion to ensure a fair and supportive workplace for all employees.

**THE LAST GREAT PROPHET**

> From [THINK AND GROW RICH by Napoleon Hill](https://ia804709.us.archive.org/4/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.91463/2015.91463.Think-And-Grow-Rich.pdf) Reviewed by Thomas Sugrue

“Mohammed was a prophet, but he never performed a miracle. He was not a mystic; he had no formal schooling; he did not begin his mission until he was forty. When he announced that he was the Messenger of God, bringing word of the true religion, he was ridiculed and labeled a lunatic. Children tripped him and women threw filth upon him. He was banished from his native city, Mecca, and his followers were stripped of their worldly goods and sent into the desert after him. When he had been preaching ten years he had nothing to show for it but banishment, poverty and ridicule. Yet before another ten years had passed, he was dictator of all Arabia, ruler of Mecca, and the head of a New World re-ligion which was to sweep to the Danube and the Pyrenees before exhausting the impetus he gave it. That impetus was three-fold: the power of words, the efficacy of prayer and man’s kinship with God.

“His career never made sense. Mohammed was born to impoverished members of a leading family of Mecca. Because Mecca, the crossroads of the world, home of the magic stone called the Caaba, great city of trade and the center of trade routes, was unsanitary, its children were sent to be raised in the desert by Bedouins. Mohammed was thus nurtured, drawing strength and health from the milk of nomad, vicarious mothers. He tended sheep and soon hired out to a rich widow as leader of her caravans. He traveled to all parts of the Eastern World, talked with many men of diverse beliefs and observed the decline of Christian  ity into warring sects. When he was twenty-eight, Khadija, the widow, looked upon him with favor, and married him. Her father would have objected to such a marriage, so she got him drunk and held him up while he gave the paternal blessing. For the next twelve years Mohammed lived as a rich and respected and very shrewd trader. Then he took to wandering in the desert, and one day he returned with the first verse of the Koran and told Khadija that the archangel Gabriel had appeared to him and said that he was to be the Messenger of God.

“The Koran, the revealed word of God, was the closest thing to a miracle in Mohammed’s life. He had not been a poet; he had no gift of words. Yet the verses of the Koran, as he received them and recited them to the faithful, were better than any verses which the professional poets of the tribes could produce. This, to the Arabs, was a miracle. To them the gift of words was the greatest gift, the poet was all-powerful. In addition the Koran said that all men were equal before God, that the world should be a democratic state-Islam. It was this political heresy, plus Mohammed’s desire to destroy all the 360 idols in the courtyard of the Caaba, which brought about his banishment. The idols brought the desert tribes to Mecca, and that meant trade. So the business men of Mecca, the capitalists, of which he had been one, set upon Mohammed. Then he retreated to the desert and demanded sovereignty over the world.

“The rise of Islam began. Out of the desert came a flame which would not be extinguished-a democratic army fighting as a unit and prepared to die without wincing. Mohammed had invited the Jews and Christians to join him; for he was not building a new religion. He was calling all who believed in one God to join in a single faith. If the Jews and Christians had accepted his invitation Islam would have conquered the world. They didn’t. They would not even accept Mohammed’s innovation of humane warfare. When the armies of the prophet entered Jerusalem not a single person was killed because of his faith. When the crusaders entered the city, centuries later, not a Moslem man, woman, or child was spared. But the Christians did accept one Moslem idea-the place of learning, the university.”
