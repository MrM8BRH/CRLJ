1. **Code (`java/kotlin`) + Libraries + Resources ⇒ Compile ⇒ `DEX`**
    - **Development Stage**: Developers write Android applications using languages like **Java** or **Kotlin**. The code is then combined with any necessary **libraries** (dependencies) and **resources** (such as images, strings, layouts) required for the application.
    - **Compilation**: The code is compiled into **Dalvik Executable (DEX)** format. The DEX file contains optimized bytecode, which is executable by the Android runtime (either **Dalvik VM** or **ART**). This is a crucial step, as Android devices cannot directly run Java bytecode; they need the DEX format.
2. **`DEX` + Build (`lib + resources`) ⇒ `APK`**
    - **APK Creation**: The compiled DEX file, along with the application’s **libraries** (`lib`), and **resources** (such as images, layouts, etc.), are packaged together into a single **APK** file (Android Package). The APK is essentially the entire application in a format ready for distribution and installation.
3. **`APK` + Signed (Cert) ⇒ Signed APK**
    - **Signing the APK**: For security and authenticity, the APK must be **signed** with a cryptographic certificate before it can be distributed. This signing ensures that the application comes from a trusted developer and hasn’t been tampered with.
    - **Release Version**: The signing process involves using a private key to create a **digital signature**, which is embedded into the APK. If the APK is intended for distribution on **Google Play**, it is signed with a **release key**. For testing or internal distribution, a debug key may be used.
4. **Signed APK + Google Play ⇒ Installed on User Device**
    - **Google Play Distribution**: Once the APK is signed, it is uploaded to **Google Play Store** (or any other distribution platform, like third-party stores). When a user installs the application from the store, the APK is downloaded to the user’s device.
    - **Installation**: The device installs the APK, unpacks the DEX file, libraries, and resources, and the application is now ready to be launched and executed.
