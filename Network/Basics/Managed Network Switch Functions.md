### **1. Network Segmentation & Traffic Control**
- **VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)**: Segment networks logically to isolate traffic and enhance security.
- **Layer 3 Routing**: Inter-VLAN routing, static routing, and support for dynamic routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF).
- **QoS (Quality of Service)**: Prioritize critical traffic (e.g., VoIP, video) to reduce latency and jitter.
- **Traffic Shaping/Rate Limiting**: Control bandwidth allocation per port or application.
- **Link Aggregation (LACP)**: Combine multiple ports into a single logical link for increased bandwidth and redundancy (e.g., 802.3ad).
### **2. Security Features**
- **ACLs (Access Control Lists)**: Filter traffic based on IP/MAC addresses, ports, or protocols.
- **Port Security**: Restrict access by limiting MAC addresses per port.
- **802.1X Authentication**: Authenticate devices via RADIUS/TACACS+ for network access.
- **DHCP Snooping**: Block unauthorized DHCP servers.
- **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)**: Prevent ARP spoofing attacks.
- **IP Source Guard**: Validate IP-MAC bindings to prevent spoofing.
- **MAC Address Filtering**: Allow/block devices based on MAC addresses.
- **SSH/HTTPS Encryption**: Secure management access.
### **3. Monitoring & Diagnostics**
- **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**: Monitor and manage network devices.
- **Port Mirroring (SPAN)**: Copy traffic from one port to another for analysis.
- **sFlow/NetFlow**: Collect traffic statistics for monitoring and reporting.
- **Loop Detection (STP/RSTP/MSTP)**: Prevent network loops with Spanning Tree Protocols.
- **Cable Diagnostics**: Detect cable faults (e.g., shorts, opens).
- **Logging & Alerts**: Generate logs and notifications for events (e.g., port status changes).
### **4. Redundancy & High Availability**
- **Stacking**: Combine multiple switches into a single logical unit for simplified management.
- **VRRP/HSRP**: Router redundancy protocols for failover.
- **UPS Integration**: Support for uninterruptible power supply monitoring.
### **5. Multicast Management**
- **IGMP Snooping**: Optimize multicast traffic forwarding.
- **Multicast VLAN Registration (MVR)**: Stream multicast traffic across VLANs.
### **6. Power over Ethernet (PoE) Management**
- **PoE/PoE+ Support**: Deliver power to devices (e.g., IP cameras, phones).
- **Power Scheduling**: Turn PoE ports on/off based on schedules.
- **Power Monitoring**: Track power usage per port.
### **7. Advanced Traffic Handling**
- **Jumbo Frames**: Support for larger MTU sizes (e.g., 9K bytes) for high-throughput data.
- **Storm Control**: Suppress broadcast/multicast/unicast floods.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across aggregated links.
### **8. Management & Configuration**
- **CLI/Web Interface/SSH**: Remote configuration options.
- **Firmware Updates**: In-field upgrades for features and security.
- **Configuration Backups/Restore**: Save/load switch settings.
- **Automation APIs**: Support for RESTful APIs or scripting (e.g., Python).
### **9. Environmental & Energy Efficiency**
- **Energy-Efficient Ethernet (802.3az)**: Reduce power consumption during low traffic.
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Track switch operating conditions.
### **10. Guest Access & Captive Portals**
- **Guest VLANs**: Isolate guest traffic from the main network.
- **Captive Portal Integration**: Redirect users to login pages for network access.
### **11. Compliance & Reporting**
- **Audit Trails**: Track configuration changes.
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate reports for regulatory standards (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS).
### **12. Layer 4-7 Features (Advanced Switches)**
- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)**: Analyze application-layer traffic.
- **Firewall Rules**: Enforce stateful traffic policies.
