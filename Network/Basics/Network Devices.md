1. **Router**: Connects multiple networks, directing data packets between them. It manages traffic and provides access to the internet.
2. **Switch**: Connects devices within a single network, using MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination. It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2).
3. **Hub**: A basic networking device that connects multiple Ethernet devices, making them act as a single network segment. It broadcasts data to all ports, which can lead to collisions.
4. **Access Point (AP)**: Extends a wired network by adding Wi-Fi capability, allowing wireless devices to connect to the network.
5. **Firewall**: Monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It can be hardware-based or software-based.
6. **Modem**: Modulates and demodulates signals for data transmission over telephone lines, cable systems, or satellite connections, enabling internet access.
7. **Network Interface Card (NIC)**: A hardware component that allows devices to connect to a network, either wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi).
8. **Repeater**: Amplifies and regenerates signals in a network to extend the transmission distance, commonly used in long-distance connections.
9. **Bridge**: Connects two or more network segments, filtering traffic and reducing collisions by dividing traffic into separate collision domains.
10. **Gateway**: Acts as a "gate" between two networks, often with different protocols, enabling communication and data transfer between them.

| **Traffic Changes**  | None                            | None                                        | Modifies TTL & checksum in IPv4 header                          |
| **Broadcast Domain** | Single broadcast domain         | One per VLAN                                | Separate domain per interface                                   |
